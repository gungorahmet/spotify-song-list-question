    Description :         Solution is developed by Ahmet Gungor with mathematical weight calculation approach. 
                          Applied PEP8 (pycodestyle)
    TODO        :         Needs to add compare for same weights according to sort of each music lists. e.g. 3 and 7
          
  This problem was asked by Spotify.
  
  You have access to ranked lists of songs for various users..<br>
  Each song is represented as an integer, and more preferred songs appear earlier in each list..<br>
  For example, the list [4, 1, 7] indicates that a user likes song 4 the best, followed by songs 1 and 7..<br>
  Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies everyone's priorities..<br>
  
  For example, suppose your input is {[1, 7, 3], [2, 1, 6, 7, 9], [3, 9, 5]}.<br>
  In this case a satisfactory playlist could be [2, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5].
